OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian-based distros, based on Nyr's [openvpn-install](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) script

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than one minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but it has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation

`wget https://raw.github.com/host-eiweb/eiweb-openvpn/master/openvpn.sh --no-check-certificate -O openvpn.sh; chmod +x openvpn.sh; ./openvpn.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users.

- Automatic inline .ovpn file generation for Android devices
